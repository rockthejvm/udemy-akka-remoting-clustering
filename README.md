# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Akka Remoting and Clustering with Scala course

Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka Remoting and Clustering with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/akka-remoting-clustering) course on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-akka-recap`
* `2.1-remote-actors`
* `2.2-remote-actors-exercise`
* `2.2-remote-actors-exercise-boilerplate`
* `2.3-deploying-actors-remotely`
* `2.4-remote-deployment-exercise`
* `3.1-clustering-basics`
* `3.2-clustering-in-action`
* `3.3-clustering-example`
* `3.4-clustering-example-part-2`
* `3.5-clustering-exercise`
* `3.6-cluster-aware-routers`
* `4.1-cluster-singleton`
* `4.2-cluster-singleton-exercise`
* `4.3-cluster-sharding`
* `4.4-cluster-sharding-example`
* `4.5-cluster-sharding-example-part-2`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
